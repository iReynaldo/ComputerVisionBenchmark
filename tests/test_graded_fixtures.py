"""Submissions that half work, and the scores they must land between.

Every reference fixture in this suite scores exactly 1.0, and the degenerate
ones score 0.0. Nothing established that the benchmark can tell two *working*
submissions apart, which is the property that decides whether it grades or
merely detects.

These fixtures are the failure modes the course actually produces. Each one
must land strictly inside (0, 1): a fixture pinned at either end is not
graded, and the assertions say so rather than checking a threshold that a
future change could drift past unnoticed.
